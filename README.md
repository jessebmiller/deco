# Deco

A Desktop made out of Containers

## Why make a desktop out of conatiners?

Because it's cool, Jess Frazelle said so.

Because I want my environments and programs and configuration and everything to stick around no matter what machine I'm on. I want my whole computing life to be there for me wherever I go.

I want the hours and hours I can spend configuring applications to my exact desire to be worth it.

# Use

1. Install linux and docker
1. Run deco `curl deco.ops.delivery/v0/start | sh`

# Version

`0.whatever` No promises. Nothing works. Everything will change.
