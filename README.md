A Desktop made out of Containers

## Why make a desktop out of conatiners?
Because it's cool.

Because I want my environments and programs and configuration and everything to stick around no matter what machine I'm on. I want my whole computing life to be there for me wherever I go.

I want the hours and hours I can spend configuring applications to my exact desire to be worth it.
